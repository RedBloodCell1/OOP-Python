Today, i will start studying about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). I will try to FULLY UNDERSTAND all the concept within it.

Lets start:

## Day 1:

- Simple things, I learned something new which is what "self" inside a method. So the self itself is python by default pass 1 argument to the methods which is the class itself. wow...
- I will continue tomorrow. See you guys
- Oh a little update, you guys might wonder where have I been these days, well some days before, I just finished my thesis presentation and of course i still keep my promise of doing at least 1 meaningful problem each day. So yeah i did just that but i just didn't do it with my own laptop. So yeah, now im back here. thats cool

## Day 2:

- Lets continue. So `__init__` is called when we initiate an object
- **Instance attribute?** (OHHH so this means instance attribute is atribute that is assign on the function?)
- **Class attribute?** (So class attribute is simply attribute that is assign to the Class itself)
- What does attribute even mean? Is it like a variable with a value?
- So what i learned is, when a method doesnt find an attribute in its own method / instance, it will try to find it in the Class attribute
- So there is this magic attribute that i am going to list here for now on:
  - `__dict__` = To show the attribute inside a class or method
  - `__repr__` = Represent the address of the class variable / attribute
