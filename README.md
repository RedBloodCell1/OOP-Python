Today, i will start studying about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). I will try to FULLY UNDERSTAND all the concept within it.

Lets start:

## Day 1:

- Simple things, I learned something new which is what "self" inside a method. So the self itself is python by default pass 1 argument to the methods which is the class itself. wow...
- I will continue tomorrow. See you guys
- Oh a little update, you guys might wonder where have I been these days, well some days before, I just finished my thesis presentation and of course i still keep my promise of doing at least 1 meaningful problem each day. So yeah i did just that but i just didn't do it with my own laptop. So yeah, now im back here. thats cool
